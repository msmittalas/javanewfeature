Functional Interfaces
Default Method in interface
Static Method in interface
Predicate / Function / Consumer Interface 
Lambda Expression
:: method ref.
Stream API
Date & Time API   (joda.org introduced   thats why knws as JODA API)


 1996 1 version
 
Main intension 
	More focused  on 
	1. To simplify programming 
	2. To enable Functional Programming ( benefits of Fun Prog)
	3. To get the benefits of Multi-Core benefits  Parallel Programming using Stream API

USe of Lambda :
1. to enable Functional Programming in Java
2. to write more readable  , maintainable and concise code 
3. to use other APIS very easily 
4. to enable Parallel Processing

lambda : 
  can take any number of parameter
  if only one param then no parathesis not req
  if only one statement in function then no curly parathensis 
  return keyword is not required 
-----------------------------------------------
Functional Interface : 
	Interface with only one method 
	Example :-> Runnable / Callable / ActionListener /Comparable  compareTo()/  Comparator compare()
	Function interface can be used to invoke 
	Any number of default/ static method 
	Only One Abstract method
	@FunctionalInterface annotation optional 
	
-------------------------------------------------
Default Method in interface :  
 No Concrete methods were present in Interface
 Every variable in interface is p s final
 why we need Default Method ?
 from 1.8 version  we can put concrete method in interface
